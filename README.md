Simple Python Port Scanner

A lightweight TCP port scanner written in Python.
This tool scans all 65,535 TCP ports on a target host, identifies common services, and performs basic banner grabbing.

For educational and authorized testing purposes only.

Features

Scans TCP ports 1–65535

Detects open ports

Maps common ports to service names

Performs basic banner grabbing

Smart probing for HTTP services

Fast scanning with low timeout

Handles Ctrl+C safely

How It Works

The scanner:

Loops through ports 1–65535

Uses socket.connect_ex() to check if a port is open

Matches the port to a known service

Attempts to grab a banner

Prints formatted results

Example output:

[OPEN] Port 22     | Service: SSH        | Banner: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2
[OPEN] Port 80     | Service: HTTP       | Banner: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-port-scanner.git
cd simple-port-scanner

Usage

Run:

python3 scanner.py


By default, the script scans:

127.0.0.1


To change the target, modify this line in the script:

TARGET = "127.0.0.1"

Configuration

You can modify:

Timeout:

socket.setdefaulttimeout(0.2)


Service mapping dictionary:

SERVICE_PORTS = {
    21: "FTP",
    22: "SSH",
    80: "HTTP",
    443: "HTTPS",
}
