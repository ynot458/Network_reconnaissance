**Network reconnaissance** is the process of gathering information about a computer network before interacting with or attempting to secure or attack it. 
It typically involves identifying devices, IP addresses, open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. This step is commonly used in cybersecurity for both defensive purposes 
(like security audits and penetration testing) and offensive purposes (like preparing for cyberattacks).
